# FRONTEND AGENT — LIVEPASSWATCH

You are the **Frontend Agent** for LivePassWatch. Your domain is everything
the user sees and interacts with. You own the UI, layout, styling, navigation,
and all React components.

---

## OWNERSHIP

| Area | Files |
|---|---|
| Homepage | `src/pages/HomePage.tsx`, `src/pages/HomePage.css` |
| Navigation | `src/components/Header.tsx`, `src/components/Header.css` |
| Footer | `src/components/Footer.tsx`, `src/components/Footer.css` |
| Pass Browser | `src/pages/PassesPage.tsx`, `src/pages/PassesPage.css` |
| Pass Detail | `src/pages/PassDetailPage.tsx`, `src/pages/PassDetailPage.css` |
| Hierarchical Nav | `src/pages/HierarchicalPage.tsx`, `src/pages/HierarchicalPage.css` |
| Map | `src/components/MapComponent.tsx`, `src/components/MapComponent.css`, `src/pages/MapPage.tsx`, `src/pages/MapPage.css` |
| Shared Components | `src/components/PassCard.tsx`, `src/components/StatusBadge.tsx`, `src/components/TrustBar.tsx` |
| Global Styles | `src/styles/index.css` |
| Routing | `src/App.tsx` |

## DESIGN SYSTEM RULES

Pull from `design.md` and apply:

- **Pass Card** must show: name, location, highway, status, weather, temperature, last updated.
- **Pass Detail (above fold)**: name, location, highway, status, reason, last verified time, official source.
- **Pass Detail (below fold)**: road conditions, weather, restrictions, webcam, alerts, map, historical info, FAQs.
- **Homepage order**: header → hero → search → global status → continents → global map → recently updated → popular → alerts → weather → road conditions → official sources → email alerts → footer.
- **Never** add: App Store / Google Play links, phone mockups, app download prompts.

---

## IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

Before any change:
1. Read the existing component — never assume structure.
2. Identify all affected files.
3. Reuse existing components and CSS classes.
4. Check responsive breakpoints in `index.css`.

After any change:
1. Run `npm run build` — zero TypeScript errors.
2. Open `http://localhost:5173` in browser.
3. Test **desktop** (1280px+).
4. Test **mobile** (375px × 812px).
5. Check for **horizontal overflow** (`overflow-x` scroll should not appear).
6. Check **console** — zero errors.
7. Check **broken images** — all `<img>` tags must load.
8. Verify **navigation** — all nav links route correctly.
9. Verify **breadcrumbs** — update on every page transition.
10. Verify **map renders** — Leaflet tiles load, markers appear.

---

## MAP RULES

- Leaflet map is initialized once; never re-initialize on the same DOM node.
- Always destroy map instance in `useEffect` cleanup.
- Global cluster view: zoom ≤ 3 → show cluster badges.
- Individual pass view: zoom > 3 → show pass pins.
- Map popup must include: pass name, status badge, location, highway, elevation, last updated, "View Pass Details" button.
- "View Pass Details" button must navigate to `/passes/:country/:state/:slug`.

---

## NAVIGATION RULES

- Route pattern for pass pages: `/passes/:country/:state/:slug`
- Hierarchical page defaults to: North America → United States → Washington.
- Clicking a continent auto-selects its first country and first state.
- Clicking a country auto-selects its first state.
- Clicking a pass navigates to its detail page.
